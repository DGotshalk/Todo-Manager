# Todo-Manger
A todo manager written with qt to help me focus and organize

## Things To Do:
- Add and remove current items from the list
	- This is in the QListWidget Signals section, when an item is clicked to edit it, and then to remove a selected item.
- ability to organize the list ( priorities, numbers )
	- Not important, but possible to do with drag and dropping
- bigger list in general 
- Tie the current list displayed daily list to the day on the calendar
